# RIME_InstrumentBuilder



The RIME Instrument Builder is a desktop application for creating and modifying a set of controls, that is then synced to the RIME mobile application.

The interface features drag and drop placement of controls, as well as a sidebar to monitor incoming sensor value from the mobile application.

Head to the [Layout Building](https://github.com/adamjberg/RIME_InstrumentBuilder/wiki/Layout-Building) section to get started.
